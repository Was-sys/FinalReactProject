        <p>It all started with a big dream in a little store on a busy Kolpetty street. Fifteen years later, we have grown, both in square footage & in soul. This is our story.

        FASHON PLUS has always been driven by a passion for fashion. A family business, our goal has always been to provide affordable clothing to our loyal customers. Our ethos has served us well - 15 years later with two outlets in the bustling urban landscape of Colombo, we have established ourselves as a leading department store in our little island paradise. We have something for everyone.

Our award winning flagship store sits in scenic Rajagiriya & is a product of great collaboration amongst some of the finest architects in Sri Lanka. 

Last September, we shifted our very first outlet in Kolpetty to Bambalapitiya. The move was brought about by years of feedback gathered from our customers â€“ you wanted more shopping space, more parking & more styles. We listened. Our Bamba store is four floors strong & has gained a popular following in the area since we opened our doors.

Now we created this website to bring you the Beverly Street shopping experience from the comfort of your own home.
